      <h2>
      I find Zen Garden really interesting because of how it shows the users how many different ways CSS can be used to manipulate the webpage. I believe that Zen Gardens should be shown to many upcoming computer science majors or even regular people who want to be self-taught. This website is perfect for introducing users to a creative way of editing webpages with virtually infinite numbers of ways to design or redesign yours or someone else's webpage. Another thing I find interesting about the website is that it relays the designers pride in their work on CSS through the way people react to their designs. I liked a lot of the designs, some for their simplicity, others for their interesting color palettes. The layout I chose as my favorite one is named <i>Screen Filler</i> by Elliot Jay Stocks. I chose this one because it embodied both simplicity and vibrancy. One thing I noticed about this layout is the use of floats and borders to separate yet combine the paragraphs. For example, the border colors overlapped to create a different color and I thought that looked pleasing. Another thing I like about the designer's use of floats is how he placed them next to eachother because it's more convenient and easier to read.
