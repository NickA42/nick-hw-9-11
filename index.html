      Zen Gardens
      </h1> 
      
      <h2>
      I find Zen Garden really interesting because of how it shows the users how many different ways CSS can be used to manipulate the webpage. I believe that Zen Gardens should be shown to many upcoming computer science majors or even regular people who want to be self-taught. This website is perfect for introducing users to a creative way of editing webpages with virtually infinite numbers of ways to design or redesign your/someone's webpage.
